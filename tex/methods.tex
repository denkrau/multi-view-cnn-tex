This chapter explains the implementation of the neural network architecture for classifying objects and the generation and preparation of the dataset.
Each data sample used as an input for the network consists of multiple viewing perspectives of an object, a so-called multi-view.
Each object has duplicates, where a different color mark is applied to each copy.
The intention is to examine how the multi-view approach known from \cite{Su:2015:MCN:2919332.2919750} and, in particular, \cite{Feng2018} relates to multi-views where the shape of objects is the same but only differs in color marks.
Furthermore, it is analyzed how each view of a data sample contributes to the classification result.
In this context, the class of each object is referred to by a combination of its type of object and color mark.
Hence, the terminology category describes the first and color the latter.
The creation of the dataset is performed with the Blender API interface, while the model is written in Python using the tensorflow framework.
