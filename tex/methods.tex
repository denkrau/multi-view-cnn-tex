This chapter explains the generation and preparation of the dataset and the implementation of the neural network architecture for classifying objects depending on their color feature.
The input consists of multiple views of an object, while percentages of class memberships are outputted.
The creation of the dataset is supported by the Blender API interface, while the model is written in Python using the tensorflow framework.
