\section{Artificial Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neural-networks}
This section investigates the types of neural networks that are important for this work.
Furthermore, it explains how these types are structured and trained in order to fulfill an objective like a certain object classification.
General knowledge for this is taken from \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016} and \cite{cs231n}.
