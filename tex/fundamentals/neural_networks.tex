\section{Artificial Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neural-networks}
This section examines the types of neural networks that are important for this work.
Furthermore, it explains how these types are built and trained in order to achieve the wanted use case.
General knowledge is taken from \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016} and \cite{cs231n}.
