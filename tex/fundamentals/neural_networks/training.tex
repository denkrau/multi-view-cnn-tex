\subsection{Training}
\label{sec:neural-networks-training}
Thus far optimal weights and biases were assumed in all examples.
But in practical terms they need to be found first.
This starts by generating and preparing a dataset from which the network can find correlations by changing the weights and biases.
First, these are initialized.
Then, a input is feed-forwarded through the network.
This classification is put into a cost function.
The result is back-propagated through the network by computing its gradients for changing the weight and biases.
The forward pass and backward pass are repeated with different samples until an exit condition is satisfied.
\figref{fig:training} illustrates this process.
Each of these steps is covered in the following sections.
