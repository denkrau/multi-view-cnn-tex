\subsection{Metrics for Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:neural-networks-metrics}
When the training of a network is finished, its performance needs to be expressed in numbers.
There are several common metrics available, that depend on some definitions that will be introduced first.
A true positive $TP$ is a correct prediction of asample.
A true negative $TN$ is a correct rejection of a sample, i.e. the network knows that a certain sample does not belong to a certain category.
Furthermore, a false positive $FP$ is a false classified sample
