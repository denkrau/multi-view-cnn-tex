\subsection{Choice of Hyperparameters and Activations}
\label{sec:neural-networks-improving-performance}
Earlier sections make general recommendations on hyperparameters.
Finding well-suited ones is a trial-and-error method and requires much time.
However, there are methods that aim to find a good starting point.
Some of them are going to be presented in the following.
