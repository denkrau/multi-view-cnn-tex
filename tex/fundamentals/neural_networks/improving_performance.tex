\subsection{Improving Performance}
\label{sec:neural-networks-improving-performance}
Earlier sections make general recommendations on hyperparameters.
Nevertheless, there is room for improvement.
Finding well-suited hyperparameters is a trial-and-error method and requires much time.
However, there are methods that aim to find a good starting point.
Those are going to be presented in the following.
