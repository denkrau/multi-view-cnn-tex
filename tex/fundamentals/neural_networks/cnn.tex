\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neural-networks-convolutional-neural-networks}
Convolutional neural networks are suited for image processing tasks, because they perform better than the multilayer perceptrons architecture regarding accuracy and the number of parameters\cite{Lecun98}\cite{LeCun1998cnn}.
The reason for the first one is most likely that they are invariant regarding the position of an object within an image.
Convolutional neural networks do not have a as strict separation in multiple layers as multilayer perceptrons do.
They rather have a pool of several layers which can be arbitrarily connected to fulfill one's needs.
Combinations of these layers and their hyperparameters is called a architecture.
There are different proposed architectures with their weights and biases available.
The most common ones are AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet and ResNet.
