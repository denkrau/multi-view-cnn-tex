\subsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neural-networks-convolutional-neural-networks}
Convolutional neural networks are suited for image processing tasks because they perform better than the multilayer perceptrons architecture regarding the accuracy and the number of parameters\cite{Lecun98}\cite{LeCun1998cnn}.
The reason for the first one is most likely that they are invariant regarding the position of an object within an image.
Convolutional neural networks do not have an as strict separation in multiple layers as multilayer perceptrons do.
They rather have a pool of several layers which can be arbitrarily connected to fulfill one's needs.
Combinations of these layers and their hyperparameters are called architecture.
There are different proposed architectures with their weights and biases available.
The most common ones are AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet and, ResNet.
