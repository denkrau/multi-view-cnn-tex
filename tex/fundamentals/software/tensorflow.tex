\subsection{Tensorflow}
\label{sec:software-tensorflow}
Tensorflow is a free framework in particular for machine learning tasks.
It was originally developed by Google Brain for internal Google use and got finally licensed for open source. 
Mathematical operations are designed as a symbolic graph.
After its creation, any operation inside can be executed and only needs the computation of its dependent operations.
Every computation involves tensors.
A tensor is a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices independent on their dimension.
Hence, a definition of every tensor's size is important for a cost-effective creation and computation of the graph.
Due to the symbolic graph, it is possible to define a neural net with an input and output layer and steadily feed and compare different tensor values.
