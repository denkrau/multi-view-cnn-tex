\section{Multi-View Network Architecture}
\label{sec:methods-architecture}
Because convolutional neural networks are well-suited for image classification task, this approach is pursued.
Furthermore, in \cite{Su:2015:MCN:2919332.2919750} the VGG-M\cite{journals/corr/ChatfieldSVZ14} architecture is used and in \cite{Feng2018} GoogLeNet\cite{szegedy2015}.
Both are convolutional neural networks, where the first uses 8 layers and the latter, that is more recent, 22, however, both of them yield satisfying results.
The number of parameters of both is too large for the available resources for this work, though.
Hence, the AlexNet architecture\cite{Krizhevsky:2012:ICD:2999134.2999257} is chosen.
It is very similar to the VGG-M one, but uses larger filters for convolutions and less nodes in the fully connected layers.
However, the lesser parameters are a trade-off for accuracy.

In \cite{Feng2018} it is shown that the performance of the network from \cite{Su:2015:MCN:2919332.2919750} can be improved even more by grouping views with similar informational content and giving their descriptors more weight during the classification.
It is supposed that in particular the grouping process suits the task of distinguishing same models with different materials very well.
Because the material is the only difference, the related views should be weighted the most while all others should only play a marginal role in the classification process.
This would reduce noise and thus results in a better performance.
Hence, the network is divided into three important modules as illustrated in \figref{fig:architecture-modules}.
The feature module takes all views of an object and calculates a descriptor for each.
Those are fed to the grouping module, that groups views dependent on their information content and generates a descriptor for every group and additionally their weight.
Dependent on those outputs a single descriptor is calculated, that describes the inputted shape or object, respectively, and is used for the classification.
Each of the modules is examined in detail in the following sections.
