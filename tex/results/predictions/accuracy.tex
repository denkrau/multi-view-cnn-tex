\subsection{Class Accuracies}
\label{sec:predictions-accuracies}
The class accuracies of the single-category networks are presented in \tabref{tab:single-category-accuracies}.
Every material consists of 27 multi-views.
Supported by its small loss, the 0-3 network has an overall accuracy of 100\%.
The more materials are added, the worse the accuracies of the related models get.
This decrease is only slightly, though.
Furthermore, it can be seen, that the accuracies of the blank models are always exact.
Due to being the most simple case, it is not surprising.
The networks just need to realize, that there is no specific material color present.
For the 0-4 network, something strange happens.
Although the accuracies seem ordinary, the misclassifications are interesting.
It classifies 5 images with a red material feature as blank objects.
Something similar happens for the green-red material features.
There are 5 ones classified as green.
However, this is more understandable than the blank misclassifications, due to the actual existence of that color.
How this could happen is discussed for all networks based on the actual views, but for reasons of overview just in the following subsection.
The 0-5 network classifies 14 objects as green-green when they only have one green feature, hence the bad accuracy of this class.
This is understandable, though.
Perhaps those features are placed next to each other and seem like a single one.
For the green-green class, only two multi-views are predicted wrong.
In fact as the single-green class.
This shows, that the network generally prefers a green-green prediction.
Those misclassifications would even out perhaps with more training epochs or data samples for learning better correlations.
The results of the 0-5 network are similar to the 0-4 one.
14 actual green material multi-views are predicated as green-green ones, while the other way round only 2 are misclassified as single green material objects.
The 0-6 network predicts similar as well.
However, the single-feature as double-feature misclassifications are much better for the red material.
Only 4 red ones are misclassified while 12 green ones are misclassified.
The predictions vice versa are better for the green material, though.
Only 2 are wrongly predicted as a single-material feature for the green ones and 8 for the red ones.
It seems like the networks prefer double green features and single red features.
Because this is valid for all of them, taking the weight initialization as the reason is unlikely.
Moreover, for each object, the same optimal faces are colored, so an unbalanced learning due to the dataset prevented.
But why exactly the networks behave like that remains unknown for now. 
%TODO why does the network prefer double green and single red?

The per class type accuracies of the four-category networks are shown in \tabref{tab:four-category-accuracies}.
In general, they are slightly better than the ones of the single-category networks, though they are more complicated.
This is presumably due to the larger training sets.
The 4-0 network predicts 5 bathtub objects as sofas, 1 dresser object as a monitor and 2 sofa objects as dressers.
That seems like all object categories share some features for being able to misclassify them as different categories.
For example, if only bathtubs are misclassified as sofas and sofas are misclassified as bathtubs, it is certain that only those categories share features.
However, that are not many wrong predictions, so again a longer training should increase the accuracies.
The 4-3 network predicts some bathtubs as sofas as well, but each predicted material feature is correct.
In numbers, it is five, four and one wrong predictions per related material feature.
This shows, that at least for bathtubs green-red materials can be classified almost easily.
Furthermore, some dressers are mistaken for monitors and some sofas for dressers.
Those wrong predictions match the earlier network.
Moreover, a few colored objects are predicted as the same blank object.
This happens four times for sofas and once for monitors and dressers.
For the 4-4 network almost the same prediction characteristics are valid as for the earlier four-category networks.
Surprisingly is that every monitor object is classified correctly.
Maybe this is due to a well-suited weight initialization because the actual network architecture is unchanged.
The 4-5 and 4-6 networks experience a sudden drop in overall accuracy.
This was also the case with the single-category networks, but not that drastically.
Apparently, the double material features are more challenging for multiple object categories due to more features.
Furthermore, both networks share some prediction characteristics of the earlier networks.
The favorite misclassification categories of the actual categories persist.
However, this is mostly for bathtubs.
The remaining categories mostly predict wrong within their category.
In particular the 4-5 network is really good with the dresser classes, however, its green-green class is the worst within that category.
For bathtubs, the single-green class is the worst within, because it has the most misclassifications in this category with 6 objects as double-green bathtubs.
Vice versa only two multi-views are predicted wrongly.
For dressers, monitors, and sofas the green-green classification has by far the worst accuracy within each category.
The differences are 0.134, 0.36 and 0.154, respectively, to the second worst class within each object category.
In conclusion, this network shows, that the critical material classes are similar to the single-object networks, but it is more challenging for four-object networks to classify double-features consistently.
This is almost completely supported by the 4-6 network, because it shares those characteristics of worst material classes within somehow.
This time, though, the worst material classes for bathtubs and sofas are the single-green ones.
That confirms their correlation even more.
The single-material classes for the remaining categories are balanced.
For the double material features the red-red ones are the worst for bathtubs and monitors and the green-green ones for dressers and sofas.
Here it can be seen again, that usually one material color is preferred over the other.
Nonetheless, usually, if a material is misclassified in double-material networks, its prediction is either the single-material or double-material class of the same object.
Presumably, all the errors presented in this section can be reduced by a longer training process, so that each network learns more and better correlations for predicting similar classes.
The possibility of this is supported by the loss graphs, that show no overfitting yet.
If this does not achieve the desired result, more data samples could be added for supplying more correlations.
