\section{Overall Performance}
\label{sec:results-overall}
For evaluating the overall performances of the network architecture, the choice of hyperparameters is explained.
In \figref{fig:optimal-learning-rate} the increasing of the learning rate against the related loss is shown for finding the range of optimal learning rates.
Additionally, the change in loss is outlined.
This is performed on the 0-3 network.
At around $10^{-4}$ the loss starts to decrease slightly.
At around 0.004 its decrease gets strikingly faster until at around 0.01 it starts to increase drastically.
Although for this network, in particular, a learning rate of $10^{-2}$ seems to be suited well, a general initial learning rate of $10^{-3}$ is chosen.
On one hand, this is the most basic network, hence, it is supposed, that for more complicated ones, a smaller learning rate is better suited due to the more complex cost function.
Furthermore, interpreting those graphs is time-consuming and for more complicated networks not that easy anymore, because the loss changes more rapidly.
On the other hand, a learning rate of $10^{-2}$ is close to the increase.
Hence, if the learning rate is shifted, the parameters of the network would be changed tremendously.
It was actually verified, that a learning rate of $10^{-3}$ is a satisfiable choice for more complex networks because it lies close to the upper bound of the optimal learning rates range.
As a default value for all networks, it works as well, though.

Furthermore, the decreased filter size in the first convolutional layer from $11 \times 11$ to $7 \times 7$ compared to the original AlexNet configuration is evaluated.
In \figref{fig:first-conv-filter} the losses of the training process of both configurations are shown.

	\label{fig:first-conv-filter}
\end{figure}
It can be seen, that with the smaller filter the loss decreases over time, while for the other filter the loss saturates after 13 epochs.
The latter presumably got stuck on a saddle point before and would decrease further with more training epochs.
This could have been an unfavorable weight initialization, but based on all cost evaluations, the loss with the $7 \times 7$ filter decreases much more and faster.
That means, there were either many saddle points very close to each other, or the performance of the $11 \times 11$ filter is actually worse.
Because more recent convolutional networks tend to use smaller filters, the latter theory is assumed.
Hence, a filter with a size of $7 \times 7$ is chosen for the first convolution.

The overall training losses for all networks are shown in \figref{fig:train-loss} and the testing losses in \figref{fig:train-loss}.
For a more compact visualization of training and testing, they are only split into two separate graphs.
As expected, the 0-3 network starts with the smallest loss and proceeds the most smoothly compared to all other networks, due to its simplicity.
During training most closely to this comes the 0-4 network, however, with more rapid changes.
This is expected as well because it is just slightly more complicated.
The 0-5 and 0-6 network have since the 12th epoch the highest losses of all single category networks.
This is not surprising, because they are challenged with the double material features.
However, as the training proceeds, their cost function is noticeable going to be minimized, it just takes longer due to their complexity compared to the other single category networks.
It is surprising, though, that the remaining networks are part of the ones with the smallest losses.
Based on those, they can stick with the 0-3 model.
Moreover, since the 13th epoch, they change considerably small in loss compared to the single category ones.
However, this is difficult to explain, because the cost function is unknown.
It could be, that they are on a plateau with only a small slope.
Though it is unlikely that this happens to all of them in the same epoch when every network has different initialized weights, hence are located on different spots at the cost function.
If there is only small progress, because the parameters are close to a very small local minimum or the actual global one of each cost function, an indicator of overfitting could be noticeable in the testing losses.
However, there is no obvious increase in loss visible.
Not even in the direct comparison of each network's training and testing losses.
The only visible increase is for the 4-3 network after the 14th epoch, but it decreases after the 18th again.
So it was presumably only on a bad location for generalization.
Hence, the training of the networks can be continued for more epochs for trying to achieve a smaller loss and better generalization.
It is not surprising, that the 0-3 network has the smallest loss again.
The other networks are similar to each other.
However, it is noticeable, that the single-category networks have more rapid changes at the beginning and the remaining networks later in the training process.
This is presumably because of the different number of iterations per epoch.
The more complex networks have larger datasets, due to the additional number of material features and categories, hence, more batches with a parameter adaption after each.
This way the less complex networks need more epochs for having processed the same number of batches than a complex network.
That also explains why the four-categories networks have less noticeable changes after several epochs than the single-category ones.
For the sake of completeness, the related accuracies of the training processes are shown in \figref{fig:networks-accuracy}.
Here the same effects can be seen as with the losses.
