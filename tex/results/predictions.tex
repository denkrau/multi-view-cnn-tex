\section{Prediction Accuracy}
\label{sec:results-predictions}
Because \figref{fig:networks-accuracy} reveals no detail of the accuracy per class or data sample this is evaluated separately.
First several metrics per class are examined.
Then, depending on those results misclassifications are discussed.
