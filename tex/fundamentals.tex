\chapter{Fundamentals}
This chapter covers the fundamentals necessary to understand the methods presented and their application.
It is divided into a section on neural networks and one on the used software and frameworks.
The former starts with the principle of a neural network.
It continues with an explanation of the required steps to train the network and ends with an overview of Convolutional Neural Networks, which are networks that are more suited for image processing.
The latter explains which software and frameworks support building and training a model.
