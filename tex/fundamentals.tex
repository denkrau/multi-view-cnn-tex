\chapter{Fundamentals}
\label{sec:fundamentals}
This chapter covers the fundamentals for the methods presented and their application.
It is divided into a section on neural networks and one on the used software and frameworks.
The neural network section starts with the principle of neural networks.
It continues with an explanation of the network architectures multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks.
The first serves as an example of how networks work in general.
The second focuses on image processing and outperforms the first one in this task.
Furthermore, it is explained how a network is trained for achieving a desired objective like object classification.
It continues with an explanation of the required steps to train the network for achieving the wanted use case.
Finally, methods and parameters are examined that can help to improve the overall performance of a neural network.
The second section explains which software and frameworks support building and training a model.
