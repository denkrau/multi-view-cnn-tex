\chapter{Fundamentals}
This chapter covers the fundamentals necessary to understand the methods presented and their application.
It is divided into a section on neural networks and one on the used software and frameworks.
The former starts with the principle of a neural network.
It continues with an explanation of the network architectures multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks.
The first one serves as an example how networks work in general.
The second one is more suited for image processing and outperforms the first one in this task.
It continues with an explanation of the required steps to train the network for achieving the wanted use case.
Finally, methods and parameters are examined that improve the overall performance of a neural network.
The latter explains which software and frameworks support building and training a model.
