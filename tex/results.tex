\chapter{Results}
In this chapter the results of the network and its components are going to be presented.
First the grouping mechanism is evaluated due to being the core of the architecture.
Then the overall performance of the network is discussed, followed by an examination of misclassifications.
There are several networks training with an increasing number of category and material classes for being able to compare and dedicate possible occurring effects.
It starts with only a single category, in particular bathtubs, with first 3 different materials.
Those materials embrace the the raw object, a green feature and a red one.
This is further increased to 6 material features containing a green and red material, two green materials, and two red materials.
Finally, four categories in total are classified including additionally dressers, monitors and sofas.
Here an identical process of adding materials is performed in the same order as before.
This leads to a total of 9 networks.
However, for testing different hyperparameters, more networks have been trained on the dataset with bathtubs and 3 material.
In the following the syntax \emph{\#categories-\#materials} refers to the corresponding trained network.
Every model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 8.
Each batch element contains 12 rendered views of an object.
The initial learning rate is set to $0.0001$.
Furthermore, the dropout probability of layer 6 and 7 is specified as $0.5$, which matches the AlexNet configuration.
Any dataset samples presented or predicted belong to the test set.
